## *Grunwald_CSCI2270_FinalProject*

# **Project Summary**
This will be a linked list-esque class that provides different versions of the linked list based on need. Currently I plan on implementing a FIFO, LIFO, Priority Queue, and plain old linked list. I plan on also having a buffer that data will be stored in before being commited to the data structure. If I'm able to swing it, I will also be creating a conversion method from plain old linked list to priority, so that the data is sorted after the linked list is created. Ideally, the class will be able to act as any of the mentioned things based on it's current state.
